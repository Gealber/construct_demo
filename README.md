# Construct Demo

This is a simple demo of an API for a constructor application

# How to run?

> Common for all plattform
* Make sure you're on the `script` folder and change in depend on your plattform.
* Make sure you have an installation of Redis and MongoDB.
* Run the redis server from the folder `script/config`, in this way `redis-server redis.conf`.
* Make sure the MongoDB is working properly.

> Ubuntu or Linux based OS, only tested on Ubuntu.

```bash
./run.sh
```

> Windows

```cmd
.\run.bat
```

Not very sure since I think this type of scripts are not allowed to run.
In case you have a problem take a look at the `run.bat` file. It just sets several
environment variables, that you could set manually :), enjoy.

# Using Docker?
